# franck

Python 3 library to parse JeuxVideo.com markup.

## Video

The sole model of franck, videos. A basic usage would look like:
```
 v = Video("http://www.jeuxvideo.com/somevideopage")
 v.load()

 print(v.json.title)

 print(v.get_best_quality())
```

## API

Two functions are available to find videos at a single URL:
- video(url): use on single video page, containing a video player
- videos(url): use on video lists or any page with links to video pages

## Cache

Each video requires two files to be retrieved: its video page (HTML) and its config file (XML).
Web requests use a local cache with its own expiration policy. Jeuxvideo.com HTTP headers can't be relied upon as they expire immediately.
Cached files go under ```user_cache_dir/Franck```, eg. ```"/home/user/.cache/Franck/"```

## Crawler

The crawler can be used to heat up the cache with all video pages of a section.
It returns all the video page url found in a whole section, those pages can then be loaded/cached and their associated config file too.

# franck-http

The http module contains two parts:

- a JSON API to get a list of videos with cover and details found at a given URL
- an HTML page to query that API, display results and an inline a video player.
